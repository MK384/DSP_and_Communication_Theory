# DSP_and_Communication_Theory
### This Repo contains several sketches that I made in my journey to learn Digital Signals Processing and Analog-Digital Communication theories.
 
 #### The topics this sketches include:
 
- Sampling Theory
- DFT , DTFT , FFT
- Filters and Filtering [IIR, FIR]
- Adabtive Filters
- Multirate filters
- Audio Tuning
- Modulation [AM , FM]
- Noise effect on signals
